# Wireframing

## Introduction

Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual representation of a user interface (UI). It outlines the structure and layout of a webpage or application without focusing on colors, graphics, or detailed content. Wireframes are typically made using boxes, lines, and placeholder text to show how elements will be arranged.

## Importance in the Design Process

Wireframing is a crucial first step in UI/UX design because it:

- **Clarifies layout and navigation**  
  It helps designers, developers, and stakeholders understand where elements like menus, buttons, and images will be placed.

- **Saves time and cost**  
  Making changes at the wireframe stage is faster and cheaper than after full design or development.

- **Improves collaboration**  
  Wireframes create a shared understanding and serve as a communication tool between designers, developers, and clients.

- **Highlights usability issues early**  
  It allows testing of user flows and interactions before investing in high-fidelity designs.

Wireframing sets the foundation for intuitive, user-centered interfaces and ensures the team is aligned before moving into design and development phases.
